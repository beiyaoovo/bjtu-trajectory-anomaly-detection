"""
This module provides the algorithm T-DBSCAN and related
functions required for data preprocessing.


The algorithm T-DBSCAN is used to detect trajectory outlier.
It was presented by Zhongjian Lv and others in their paper
"Outlier Trajectory Detection: A Trajectory Analytics Based Approach,"
in DASFAA. Springer, 2017, pp 231â€“246.

def data_preprocessing(trajectory):
    """
    Data preprocessing for iT-DBSCAN algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    trajectory : list or tuple
        Elements in the list or tuple are trajectory data, and each trajectory
        is a list or tuple. The elements in the trajectory are sampling points,
        which are represented by a binary list or binary tuple. The ID in the
        graph and sampling time of the points are recorded in sequence.

    Returns
    -------
    list
    [ [point0_id, point1_id, ...], ... ]
        Preprocessed data. All sampling points are represented by node id.

def misDistance(tra1, tra2):
    """
    Calculate the best match distance between two trajectory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tra1 : list or tuple
    tra2 : list or tuple
        Elements in the list or tuple are trajectory data. The elements in the trajectory are sampling points.
    Returns
    -------
